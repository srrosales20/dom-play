  <div id="play">
    <p><span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
      Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
      And I'll no longer be a Capulet.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="romeo">Romeo: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</span></p>
    <p><Span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy: (40)
      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
      What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name.
      What's in a name? That which we call a rose
      By any other name would smell as sweet;
      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
      Retain that dear perfection which he owes
      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
      And for that name, which is no part of thee, (50)
      Take all myself.</Span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="romeo">Romeo: I take thee at thy word.
      Call me but love, and I'll be new baptis'd;
      Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</span></p>
    <p><Span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,
      So stumblest on my counsel?</Span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="romeo">Romeo: By a name
        I know not how to tell thee who I am:
        My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
        Because it is an enemy to thee. (60)
        Had I it written, I would tear the word.</span></p>
        <p><Span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
          Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.
          Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</Span></p>
          <p><Span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: Madam!</Span></p>
          <p><Span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
            I do beseech thee--</Span></p>
            <p><Span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: Madam!</Span></p>
            <p><Span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: By and by, I come:--
              To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: (160)
              To-morrow will I send.</Span></p>
